# Caring Caribou
A friendly car security exploration tool

## Rationale
We are lacking a security testing tool for automotive. A zero-knowledge tool that can be dropped onto any CAN network and collect information regarding what services and vulnerabilities exist. This is a start.

This work was initiated as part of the research project HEAVENS (HEAling Vulnerabilities to ENhance Software Security and Safety), but lives on as a stand-alone project.

## How to install
Instructions available [here](documentation/howtoinstall.md)

## Troubleshooting
See common errors and solutions [here](documentation/troubleshooting.md)

## How to use
The best way to understand how to use Caring Caribou is to look at the help screen:

    python cc.py -h

or simply

    ./cc.py -h

This will list all available modules at the bottom of the output. Help for specific modules works the same way. For example, the help screen for the `send` module is shown by running

    ./cc.py send -h

The module help always includes some usage examples. If the module has multiple sub functions, these have similar help screens as well:

    ./cc.py send message -h
    ./cc.py send file -h

More detailed usage information is available [here](https://github.com/CaringCaribou/caringcaribou/blob/master/documentation/howtouse.md).

## Features and Architecture
Caring Caribou is based on a master script `cc.py`, which runs the show. This enables an easy drop-in architecture for new modules, which are located in the `/modules` folder.

The `/lib` folder contains various higher level CAN protocol implementations and shared functions, meant to be used by modules.

The `/tests` folder contains automated test suites and `/documentation` stores module documentation files.

## List of Modules
A clean installation of Caring Caribou includes the following modules:

### uds - Universal Diagnostic Services
Discovers and utilizes various ISO 14229-1 services.
- discovery - Scans for ECUs supporting diagnostics services
- services - Scans for diagnostics services supported by an ECU
- ecu_reset - Reset an ECU
- testerpresent - Force an elevated session against an ECU to stay active
- dump_dids - Dumps values of Dynamic Data Identifiers (DIDs)

Details here: [uds module](documentation/uds.md)

### xcp - Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol (XCP)
- discovery - Scans for ECUs supporting XCP
- info - XCP Get Basic Information. Retrieves information about XCP abilities of an ECU
- dump - XCP Upload. Used to dump ECU memory (such as SRAM, flash and bootloader) to file 
- unlock - XCP unlock. unlock command groups using a custom seed & key mechanism implementation

Details here: [xcp module](documentation/xcp.md)

### fuzzer - CAN fuzzer
- random - sends random CAN messages
- brute - brute forces all possible messages matching a given bit mask
- mutate - mutate selected nibbles of a given message
- replay - replay a log file from a previous fuzzing session
- identify - replay a log file and identify message causing a specific event

Details here: [fuzzer module](documentation/fuzzer.md)

### dump - Dump CAN traffic
Dumps incoming traffic to stdout (terminal output) or file

Details here: [dump module](documentation/dump.md)

### send - Send CAN packets
Raw message transmission module, used to send messages manually from command line or replay dump files

Details here:  [send module](documentation/send.md)

### listener - Listener
Lists all distinct arbitration IDs being used on the CAN bus

Details here: [listener module](documentation/listener.md)

### test - Run test suite
Runs automated Caring Caribou test suites

### dcm - [deprecated] Diagnostics Control Module
**Note**: This module has been replaced by the [UDS](documentation/uds.md) module. It is still supported by CC due to legacy reasons.

Details here: [dcm module](documentation/dcm.md)

### uds_fuzz - Universal Diagnostic Services Fuzzer
Fuzzing module for UDS security seed randomness evaluation and testing.
- seed_randomness_fuzzer - ECUReset method fuzzing for seed randomness evaluation
- delay_fuzzer - delay fuzzing for targets with weak randomness implemented, to match acquired seed/key pair to the delay in which the seed can be requested

Details here: [uds_fuzz module](documentation/uds_fuzz.md)

### doip - Diagnostic communication over Internet Protocol
Discovers and utilizes various ISO 13400-2 services.
- discovery - Scans for ECUs supporting diagnostics services
- services - Scans for diagnostics services supported by an ECU
- ecu_reset - Reset an ECU
- security_seed - Request security seeds from an ECU
- testerpresent - Force an elevated session against an ECU to stay active
- dump_dids - Dumps values of Dynamic Data Identifiers (DIDs)
- seed_randomness_fuzzer - ECUReset method fuzzing for seed randomness evaluation

Details here: [doip module](documentation/doip.md)

## List of libraries
The `/lib` folder contains the following libraries:

### can_actions.py
Provides abstraction for access to the CAN bus, bruteforce engines etc.

### common.py
Contains various common functions, type converters etc.

### constants.py
Constant definitions

### iso14229_1.py
Implementation of the ISO-14229-1 standard for Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS).

### iso15765_2.py
Implementation of the ISO-15765-2 standard (ISO-TP). This is a transport protocol which enables sending of messages longer than 8 bytes over CAN by splitting them into multiple data frames.

## Hardware requirements
Some sort of CAN bus interface (http://elinux.org/CAN_Bus#CAN_Support_in_Linux)

## Software requirements
- Python 2.7 or 3.x
- python-can
- a pretty modern linux kernel

## Extending the project
Create a python file with a function `module_main(args)` and put it in the ```tool/modules``` folder. Caring Caribou will automagically recognize it as a module and list it in the output of `./cc.py -h`

For example, if your new module is located in `modules/foo.py` you run it with the command `./cc.py foo`. Additional arguments (if any) are passed as arguments to the `module_main` function.

A template for new modules is available in `tool/template`

## The target
The target ECU used for the development setup is an STM32F107 based dev-board from ArcCore called Arctic EVK-M3, but the tool can be used against any ECU communicating over a CAN bus.
