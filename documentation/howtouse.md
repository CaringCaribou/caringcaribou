## How to use
The best way to understand how to use Caring Caribou is to look at cc.py's help menu:
    
    cc.py -h

This will list all available modules at the bottom of the output:

```
$ cc.py -h
usage: cc.py [-h] [-i INTERFACE] module ...

-------------------
CARING CARIBOU v0.x
\_\_    _/_/
    \__/
    (oo)\_______
    (__)\       )\/
        ||-----||
        ||     ||
-------------------

A friendly car security exploration tool

positional arguments:
  module        Name of the module to run
  ...           Arguments to module

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE  force interface, e.g. 'can1' or 'vcan0'

available modules:
  dcm, dump, fuzzer, listener, send, test, xcp
```

So in order to see usage information for e.g. the `send` module, run

    $ cc.py send -h

which will show both module specific arguments and some usage examples:

```
$ cc.py send -h

-------------------
CARING CARIBOU v0.x
-------------------

Loaded module 'send'

usage: cc.py send [-h] {message,file} ...

Raw message transmission module for CaringCaribou.
Messages can be passed as command line arguments or through a file.

positional arguments:
  {message,file}

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit

Example usage:
  cc.py send message 0x7a0#c0.ff.ee.00.11.22.33.44
  cc.py send message -d 0.5 123#de.ad.be.ef 124#01.23.45
  cc.py send file can_dump.txt
  cc.py send file -d 0.2 can_dump.txt
```

Any sub-commands (in this case, `message` and `file`) have their own help screen as well. Let's have a look at the `message` option:

```
$ cc.py send message -h

-------------------
CARING CARIBOU v0.x
-------------------

Loaded module 'send'

usage: cc.py send message [-h] [--delay D] [--loop] msg [msg ...]

positional arguments:
  msg              message on format ARB_ID#DATA where ARB_ID is interpreted
                   as hex if it starts with 0x and decimal otherwise. DATA
                   consists of 1-8 bytes written in hex and separated by dots.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --delay D, -d D  delay between messages in seconds
  --loop, -l       loop message sequence (re-send over and over)
```

### Non-default interface
In order to use a non-default CAN interface for any module, you can always provide the `-i INTERFACE` flag before the module name.

For instance, in oder to send the message `c0 ff ee` with arbitration ID `0xf00` on virtual CAN bus `vcan0`, you would run

    $ cc.py -i vcan0 send message 0xf00#c0.ff.ee

More information on the different modules is available here:
+ [dcm-module](https://github.com/CaringCaribou/caringcaribou/blob/master/documentation/dcm.md)
+ [xcp-module](https://github.com/CaringCaribou/caringcaribou/blob/master/documentation/xcp.md)
+ [send-module](https://github.com/CaringCaribou/caringcaribou/blob/master/documentation/send.md)
+ [listener-module](https://github.com/CaringCaribou/caringcaribou/blob/master/documentation/listener.md)

### Virtual CAN bus
In order to communicate over CAN without access to a physical CAN bus, it is possible to use a virtual CAN bus instead. Doing this in Linux is generally as easy as running the following commands:

    sudo modprobe vcan
    sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
    sudo ip link set vcan0 up

## Example use
In this example we have connected a compatible [hardware](https://github.com/CaringCaribou/caringcaribou/blob/master/README.md#hardware-requirements) (PiCAN) to our client computer (a Raspberry Pi) and installed the software according to the [instructions](https://github.com/CaringCaribou/caringcaribou/blob/master/documentation/howtoinstall.md#raspberry-pi).

The PiCAN is then connected to a CAN bus that features one or more ECUs. Since we know very little about the target ECUs, a great start is to do some discovery. Currently, three types of discovery are available; dcm discovery, xcp discovery and the listener.

#### The listener
Let's start with the listener:

    cc.py -h
    cc.py listener -h
    cc.py listener

(stop the listener with ctrl-C)

```
Last ID: 0x002 (total found: 30)

Detected arbitration IDs:
Arb id 0x001 114 hits
Arb id 0x002 13 hits
```

On our system we found two active arbitration IDs - probably sending some important signal/measurement repeatedly. Let's investigate if diagnostics are present on some ECUs.

#### Diagnostic discovery

    cc.py dcm -h
    cc.py dcm discovery -h
    cc.py dcm discovery -min 0x003

(no need to do discovery on 0x001 and 0x002)

```
Loaded module 'dcm'

Starting diagnostics service discovery
Sending diagnostics Tester Present to 0x0733
Found diagnostics at arbitration ID 0x0733, reply at 0x0633
```

Great! Now we now what arbitration ID to use when we look for services and subfunctions:

    cc.py dcm services 0x733 0x633

This gives us that the service READ_DATA_BY_IDENTIFIER (0x22) is available. 0x22 is typically followed by a two byte parameter ID (PID). The two bytes are in positions 2 and 3 and since we want to try them all we enter both 2 and 3 into the subfunction discovery indices list

    cc.py dcm subfunc 0x733 0x633 0x22 2 3

```
Loading module 'dcm'

Starting DCM sub-function discovery
Probing sub-function 0x22 data ['0c', 'ab'] (found: 4)

Found sub-functions for services 0x22 (READ_DATA_BY_IDENTIFIER)

Sub-function 01 00
Sub-function 01 01
Sub-function 01 02
Sub-function 02 00

Terminated by user
```

#### XCP discovery
Enough with diagnostics, let's investigate XCP in more or less the same way

    cc.py xcp -h
    cc.py xcp discovery -h
    cc.py xcp discovery -min 0x003

(no need to do discovery on 0x001 and 0x002)

```
Loaded module 'xcp'

Starting XCP discovery
Sending XCP Connect to 0x03e8 > DECODE CONNECT RESPONSE

Resource protection status
(...skipping)

COMM_MODE_BASIC
(...skipping)

Found XCP at arb ID 0x03e8, reply at 0x03e9
```

For XCP you can get more information by running

    cc.py xcp info 0x3e8 0x3e9

and you can try to dump parts of the memory by using

    cc.py xcp dump 0x3e8 0x3e9 0x1f0000000 0x4800 -f bootloader.hex
