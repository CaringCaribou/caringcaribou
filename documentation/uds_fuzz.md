# UDS_Fuzz - Unified Diagnostics Services Fuzzer
The Security Access Service implemented in UDS, is used to modify the ECU data stored in memory. To grand access to this service, there is a seed/key mechanism which is customized (mainly for obscurity) by each automotive manufacturer.

Research showed that many manufacturers do not seed with enough entropy the seed/key algorithm of modern ECUs. In more detail ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarHacking/comments/m044jp/simos18_supplier_bootloader_sboot_exploit_reading/)):

> the random number generator is seeded with the system timer, which is not a source of entropy because it behaves predictably

The uds_fuzz module implements the appropriate fuzzing methodology to enumerate (seed_randomness_fuzzer) and exploit (delay_fuzzer) vulnerable ECUs.

Supported modes:
* seed_randomness_fuzzer - ECUReset method fuzzing for seed randomness evaluation
* delay_fuzzer - delay fuzzing for targets with weak randomness implemented, to match acquired seed/key pair to the delay in which the seed can be requested

As always, module help can be shown by adding the `-h` flag (as shown below). You can also show help for a specific mode by specifying the mode followed by `-h`, e.g. `caringcaribou uds_fuzz seed_randomness_fuzzer -h` or `caringcaribou uds_fuzz delay_fuzzer -h`

```

## Seed Randomness Fuzzer
Requests a security seed after a Hard ECUReset, using the supplied request sequence, to check for duplicate seeds. 

If duplicate seeds are found by the tool, it means that the ECU is potentially vulnerable and uses weak random number generation seeded by the system timer.

                        Access Seed Request). The option should be: 1003110210052705

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t ITERATIONS, --iter ITERATIONS
                        Number of iterations of seed requests. It is highly suggested to perform >=1000 for accurate
                        results. (default: 1000)
  -r RTYPE, --reset RTYPE
                        Enable reset between security seed requests. Valid RTYPE integers are: 1=hardReset, 2=key
                        off/on, 3=softReset, 4=enable rapid power shutdown, 5=disable rapid power shutdown. This
                        attack is based on hard ECUReset (1) as it targets seed randomness based on the system clock.
                        (default: hardReset)
  -id RTYPE, --inter_delay RTYPE
                        Intermediate delay between messages:(default: 0.1)
  -m RMETHOD, --reset_method RMETHOD
                        The method that the ECUReset will happen: 1=before each seed request 0=once before the seed
                        requests start (default: 1) *This method works better with option 1.*
  -d D, --delay D       Wait D seconds between reset and security seed request. You'll likely need to increase this
                        when using RTYPE: 1=hardReset. Does nothing if RTYPE is None. (default: 3.901)
```

## Delay Fuzzer
Requests a security seed after a Hard ECUReset, using the supplied request sequence, with increasing delays between the ECUReset and the seed request.

That way the exact delay needed to request the user specified seed can be matched. 

In that case, the user can access the security access service of vulnerable ECUs, with just one seed/key pair (it can be obtained in several ways) and no access to the secret key needed to generate the key from the seed.
